# odin-landing-page

Recreation of a webpage template from The Odin Project.

The goal was to replicate the content layout shown on the reference image as closely as possible to practice using Flexbox. Extra visuals were added to create a more authentic website. The content of the website describes a fictional todo app and some features.
